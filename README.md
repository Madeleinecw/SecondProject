# SecondProject
This is my first group completed with two of my peers over 7days. 
We used JavaScript with Vue and JavaScript Libraries such as Leaflet to create a Map. This was an opportunity for us to not only futher enhance our
development skills but also our GitHub and teamworking skills while using Agile methods. 

# Brief
## Educational App
The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive browser applications that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.

## MVP
A user should be able to:
view some educational content on a particular topic
be able to interact with the page to move through different sections of content

## Example Extensions
Use an API to bring in content or a database to store information.
Use charts or maps to display your information to the page.
